                        This is my personal project. It's basically app for runners where they can track all their
                        progress.
                        I wanted to create this project simply because I wanted to learn something new. I had always
                        feeling that if you want something you need to put work in. So I decided to learn Android simply
                        by developing this app. And it end up pretty well.

                        <br>
                        In this app I used GoogleMaps Api. It was first time for me to get in touch with some Api.
                        I never wondered it will be so interesting. It's great that someone created something great and
                        you can simply use it in your app. When I finnished messing up with GoogleMaps I had feeling
                        that this app in order to be special need something more. <br>
                        I decided I will use Firebase database for storing users and all they runs. When I created login
                        I thought that login also need some upgrade so I implemented Google and Facebook login.

                <div class="col xl6 l12 m12 s12">
                    <p class="flow-text">
                        Next challenge for me was figure out how to show runs of users. When It did I was wandering
                        what can I do next. I decided I will create small social app which will consist from runs of
                        users I follow. So I end up with something what is very close to social application with
                        everything what social app should have. <br><br>
                        Next step for me will be implementation of chat. So users can communicate with each other.

                        My goals for this app is to finish everything to perfection so I will be able to share it on
                        app store. I always want to create something what people can actually use daily. I know there
                        is lots of apps for runners but I hope my design and simple user interface will attract some
                        users.<br><br>
                        You can find code on my github of on this <a
                            href="https://github.com/kubekbreha/KeepUp">link</a>.
                        Feel free to fork and contribute this project.
                        There still lots of work which need to be done.
